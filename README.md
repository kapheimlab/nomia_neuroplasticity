# nomia_neuroplasticity
This repository was created to house code for a neuroplasticity project on Nomia melanderi. The code was referenced in the manuscript and all data can be found on DRYAD doi:10.5061/dryad.xksn02vfc.

##Experiment one: Nesting and age-related neuroplasticity
Files:
1) The analysis: Nmel_Experiment1_DataAnalysis 
  This is a rmarkdown file that will import data (after filling in working directory), calculate proportion data from raw values, and run statistical analyses. New CSVs will be generated along with a pdf.
    
2) Figures: Nmel_Experiment1Figures.R
  This R script will import an output file generated using the code above and use this data to create figures.
    
##Experiment two: Socially-induced neuroplasticity
3) The analysis: Nmel_Experiment2_DataAnalysis
  This is a rmarkdown file that will import data (after filling in working directory), calculate proportion data from raw values, and run statistical analyses. New CSVs will be generated along with a pdf.

2) Figures: Nmel_Experiment2Figures.R
  This R script will import an output file generated using the code above and use this data to create figures.
